# MazeGame

The goal of this project is to create a Maze game where you (The player) has to escape a maze. The Maze will be created from a image file where every black pixel will be a 8x8 wall, the first blue piexel the player starting point and the first green pixel the goal.

Step by Step process.
1. [Complete] Initialize the project on git
2. [Complete] Add Collisions that work with an "unlimited" amount of walls.
3. [Complete] Add the Maze Reading code to convert a image file into a playable maze.
4. [Complete] Add multiple layers to the maze. ex. You beat maze 1 then 2 then 3...(Untill the game runs out of maze files)
5. [Not started] Add a titlescreen where you can chose which maze to play.
6. TBD


1-3 are vital to the game, 4 would be nice to have and 5+ are all quality of life changes and cool features.
